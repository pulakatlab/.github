## Welcome to the Pulakat Lab 👋

### Cardiovascular Disease and Diabetes Research

Our work is focused on sex differences in signaling mechanisms underlying cardiovascular disease in diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and developing new treatment paradigms. We are particularly interested in miRNA and cytokine networks that contribute to sex differences in diabetes-associated heart disease and affect inflammatory responses. 

We also are working to develop an approach to deliver drugs to lower airways of lungs using a trans-tissue delivery system with a goal of mitigating chronic inflammation and cytokine storm in lungs.

### Current Research Areas

- Sex differences in diabetes-associated heart disease
- miRNA and cytokine networks in cardiovascular disease
- Trans-tissue drug delivery systems for lung treatment
- Culturing cardiac slices and human tissue samples
- Novel treatments for chronic injuries
